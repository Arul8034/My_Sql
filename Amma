Amma Is my Role model For HardWork but Always thinking About what are Speaking About her Family
And  Character's No one can Accept the Growth in my Village Still Now Because my Father not Educational Person 
yes I Agree but Very Very Good HumanBeing In our Village and Compare with others and some time not like maturity
in sometime this is this my Main Disadvantage in our marriage Because any one easily separate me from in our Family 
so I choose Sangeetha because she is a pure heart person ever i see after my mother and sister still now so i always 
pray for him and she caame As A wife for me.
